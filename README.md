# Module 2 Challenge Stock_Analysis2

## Overview of Project

Steve is helping his parents analyze the data of twelve stock options from 2017 and 2018 to determine the value return year over year of each stock option.  In our previous weekly assignment we focused on only one stock option, "DQ" and what the return rate was.  We now are looking to review all twelve options and help Steve's parents decide which option they should invest in.  Within this assignment we were provided VBA code that needed to be refactored to run through two sets of data to return the the ticker name, total daily volume, and return percentage of each stock for a given year.  

## Results

In my analysis of the two years of data provided I found that all but one stock had a positive return rate in 2017.  The one outlier being "TERP."  2018 was a different story with all but two stocks in decline from 2017 to 2018.  The only two stocks with positive returns in both 2017 and 2018 were "ENPH" and "RUN."  ENPH had an overall return rate of 234.2% and RUN had a 94.7% return rate for the two years. While neither of these stocks had the largest percent increase year over year I would advise Steve and his parents to look more into these two stock options as they both have shown growth in the two years we completed analysis on.

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code

A few advantages we discussed in class on why we refactor code is it allows VBA to help find bugs in our code, assists with the program running faster and smoother,  and allows us to tweak our code to understand more easily. While I did struggle some while completing the refactoring of the code provided I did find that my ending code is much cleaner and easier to read than the weekly assignment that I worked on during the week.  

The biggest disadvantage I found when refactoring this code was that it was extremely time consuming.  I ran into many debug issues when running the code and had to reread each line of code several times to catch issues and correct.  I believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages when refactoring code, but the ROI of the time commitment must make sense to complete the refactoring on a larger project.
